## USER ROLES

Someone in a learning project
* could be a teacher
* could be a student
* etc

We <span style="color:#e49436">may not need</span> to distinguish between user roles.

(That's good!)

#HSLIDE

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

Our platform <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

(Should be doable)

Getting things is free

So is returning things

Trimming one's collection is just as important (and difficult) as building it.
