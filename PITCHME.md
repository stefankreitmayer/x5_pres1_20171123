## How might we support
### someone's <span style="color:#3694e4">learning project</span>?

Examples and ideas based on a true story

#HSLIDE

OUTLINE
1. Our challenge
2. About learning projects
3. Curating
4. New metaphors beyond search and shopping

#HSLIDE

#CHALLENGE

Help someone in a <span style="color:#3694e4">learning project</span>
1. find
2. evaluate
3. combine
4. collect

OERs <span style="color:#e49436">effectively</span> and <span style="color:#e49436">efficiently</span>

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

Our platform <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

(Should be doable?)

## curating

transforming a pile of maybes
into a handful of go-to resources

## What Metaphors

Trolley?
Playlist?
Collection?

## Interface Design Questions

1. Would it help to provide separate containers for different types of resources?
* by format (MOOC, podcast, book, blog...)?
* by activity (watch, listen, read, write, talk, meet...)
2. What relations between resources should we visualise, and how?

#HSLIDE

## Could this be an interface?

#HSLIDE

## Curating vs studying

Someone curating a learning project
* could be a student
* could be a teacher, etc

### Therefore
1. Curating and studying are separate concerns.
2. The part of our system that supports curation <span style="color:#e49436">may not need</span> to distinguish between user roles. (Yay!)

#HSLIDE

## Project vs Situation

Learning Project
* knowledge centric
* bounded by topic
* focus on global intent + planning
* focus on large OERs
* focus on complete OERs (initially)

Learning Situation (see Colin's paper)
* learner centric
* bounded by context
* global and local intent
* includes small OERs
* includes parts of OERs

(This should be a table)

Two complementary angles of analysis. Not mututally exclusive.
