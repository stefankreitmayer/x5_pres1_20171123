## How might we support
### someone's <span style="color:#3694e4">learning project</span>?

Examples and ideas based on a true story

OUTLINE
1. Our challenge
2. About learning projects
3. Curating

#CHALLENGE

1. find
2. evaluate
3. combine

OERs <span style="color:#e49436">effectively</span> and <span style="color:#e49436">efficiently</span>

## USER ROLES

Someone in a learning project
* could be a teacher
* could be a student
* etc

We <span style="color:#e49436">may not need</span> to distinguish between user roles.

(That's good!)

#HSLIDE

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

Our platform <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

(Should be doable)

## Trolley problem 2.0

You can't put in everything

#HSLIDE

## We need new metaphors

How about multiple trolleys?

Playlists?

Other lists?

#HSLIDE

## Spotify

helps you

FIND

EVALUATE

COMBINE

COLLECT

But learning isn't like listening to music.

#HSLIDE

## Collection Metaphors

Trolley?
Playlist?
Collection?
Basket?
Tree?
Net?
Graph?
Table?
Funnel?
Bag?


#HSLIDE

## Curation Process

Integrate with study flow?

Separate curating from studying?

#HSLIDE

## Interface Challenges

Would it help to have dedicated slots for different classes of resources?

If so, how to classify?
* by format (MOOC, podcast, book, blog...)?
* by activity (watch, listen, read, write, talk, meet...)


#HSLIDE

## Interface Challenges (cont.)

How to visualise relations between resources?

## Related ideas

Learning Project
* knowledge centric
* bounded by topic
* focus on global intent + planning
* focus on large OERs
* focus on complete OERs (initially)

Learning Situation (see Colin's paper)
* learner centric
* bounded by context
* global and local intent
* includes small OERs
* includes parts of OERs

(This should be a table)

Two complementary angles of analysis. Not mututally exclusive.
