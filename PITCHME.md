## USER ROLES

Someone in a learning project
* could be a teacher
* could be a student
* etc

We <span style="color:#e49436">may not need</span> to distinguish between user roles.

(That's good!)

#HSLIDE

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

Our platform <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

(Should be doable)

## BUILDING A LEARNING PROJECT

FIND -> EVALUATE -> COMBINE -> COLLECT
