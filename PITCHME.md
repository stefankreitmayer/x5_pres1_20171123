## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

-> Our system <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

#HSLIDE

transforming a pile of maybes

into a handful of go-to resources

## Supporting each step

* FIND -> optimise search results, ...
* EVALUATE -> show plenty of information per item, facilitate preview, ...
* COMBINE -> visualise relations and modalities, ...
* COLLECT -> keep the links, organise them, ...

## Curating vs studying

Someone curating a learning project
* could be a student
* could be a teacher, etc

### Therefore
1. The curation part of our system <span style="color:#e49436">need not care</span> about user roles. (Yay!)
2. Curating (knowledge-centric) and studying (learner-centric) are <span style="color:#e49436">separate concerns</span>. (Double yay!)
