#HSLIDE

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

Our platform <span style="color:#e49436">must</span> distinguish between projects in order to avoid misguided recommendations.

(Should be doable?)

#HSLIDE

## curating

transforming a pile of maybes
into a handful of go-to resources

#HSLIDE

## Supporting each step

* FIND -> optimise search results, ...
* EVALUATE -> show plenty of information per item, facilitate preview, ...
* COMBINE -> visualise relations, balance modalities, ...
* COLLECT -> keep the links, structure and organise them, ...

#HSLIDE

## Curating vs studying

Someone curating a learning project
* could be a student
* could be a teacher, etc

### Therefore
1. The curation part of our system <span style="color:#e49436">may not need</span> to distinguish between user roles. (Yay!)
2. Curating (knowledge-centric) and studying (learner-centric) are separate concerns. (Double yay!)
